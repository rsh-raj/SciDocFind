## Final_baselines_inference.ipynb
Run this python code after uploading CSFCube-master.zip*(connecting to GPU is optional but for faster inferences it's required) to get the evaluation metrics like R-Precsion, Precision@20, and others for all the baseline models. \
A total of 7 baselines are implemented which consists of 3 abstract level baselines and 4 sentence level baselines.


## Final_finetune_inference.ipynb
Run this python code after uploading CSFCube-master.zip*(connecting to GPU is optional but for faster inferences it's required) to get the evaluation metrics like R-Precsion, Precision@20, and others for all the finetuned models. Three models are finetuned where one is sentence level model and two are abstract level models.
